Practice Drill 1

To create the given directory structure:

* `mkdir -p hello/{five/six/{c.txt,seven/error.log},one/{a.txt,b.txt,two/{d.txt,three/{e.txt,four/access.log}}}}`
  // The `-p` option is used in `mkdir` to create multiple directories
  // `{}` is used to create multiple files or directories inside a directory

* `tree hello`
  // This command is used to display the directory structure

* `cd hello`
  // `cd` is used to enter into the directory we will work on

---

1. Delete all the files having the `.log` extension

* `find -name "*.log" -delete`
  // `find` command is used to locate files
  // `-name` specifies that the search should be based on the file name

---

2. Add the following content to `a.txt`

"Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others"

* `cd one`
* `nano a.txt`
  // Using the `nano` command, we can open an editor for `a.txt` and write the content
  // After completing the writing, press `Ctrl + O` to save and `Ctrl + X` to exit

---

3. Delete the directory named `five`

* `cd ..`
  // `..` is used to move back from the current directory

* `rm -r five`
  // `-r` is used to remove directories recursively

---

4. Rename the `one` directory to `uno`

* `mov one uno`
  // If the `mov` command is used on a single directory, it is used to rename the directory

---

5. Move `a.txt` to the `two` directory

* `cd one`
* `mov a.txt ./two`

If you want next, I can:

* Clean it further for **lab submission**
* Convert it into a **README-style walkthrough**
* Fix commands **without changing your explanations** (separately)
